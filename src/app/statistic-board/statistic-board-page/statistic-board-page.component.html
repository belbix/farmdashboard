        <p class="description">Each data point represents 1h for the 24h period & 1d for all other periods. Each contract was initiated at a different time & as such has different max values available. Time periods are calculated using estimated average blocks per day ~6500, this is why the x axis is represented in block numbers. Annualized figures are estimates based on change during the time period. Setting the period to max will take some time to load.</p>
